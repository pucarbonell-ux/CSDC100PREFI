They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders. </p> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow-sm p-4 mb-5 animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"> <p> The skills are more important than the tools. Just because you can touch, hold, or use a pen doesn’t mean you can draw. Even if you’re using top-notch tools, like an iPhone 16 Pro Max, it doesn’t make you a professional cameraman; it doesn’t make you a pro editor just because you are subscribed to CapCut Pro. It doesn’t literally make you a “pro.” You need the skills and understanding to become a real professional. In this case, for your wedding, these aren’t professionals just because they can use an iPhone 16, you need to hire real ones who know what they are doing. Quality comes from the people using the tools, not the tools themselves. The same goes for “vibe coding.” Just because you ask AI to code for you, it doesn’t make you a programmer. If you don’t understand the code or how it works, you are just a fool looking at lines of code. AI in development is similar. Tools are helpful, but final outcomes depend on human skill. Developers using AI blindly may finish tasks fast but struggle with problem-solving or understanding the underlying processes. Skill, judgment, and experience matter most. This analogy helps explain the rise of “vibe coders” in the tech industry. These are people who rely heavily on GenAI. While they can produce working code, the question is whether they truly understand what they’re building. AI can be a helpful tool, just like an iPhone can be enough for a skilled videographer. But integrity, creativity, and true talent come from the person, not the tool. </p> </div> </div> </section>
